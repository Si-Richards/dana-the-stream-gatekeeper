# Dana - The Stream Gatekeeper

A React based front-end demo for Asterisk's SFU capabilities - designed to show how you'd build a solution using modern JavaScript tooling such as React

You'll need Node.js installed on your dev environment and prferably Yarn over npm.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and utilises [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [JsSIP](https://jssip.net/)

## Install

```bash
yarn
```

## Run

```bash
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build for production

```bash
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
